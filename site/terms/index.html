        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="note">Last updated: January 5th, 2026</p>
        <p>
          Welcome to In Institution. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our mobile
          application and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these
          Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to
          notify you as required by applicable law.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the updated Terms become effective constitutes your acceptance of the
          changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, do not continue using the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Accounts and security</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities
          that occur under your account.</p>
        <p>If you believe your account has been compromised, notify us promptly and take steps to secure your account.
        </p>

        <h2>3. License and acceptable use</h2>
        <p>We grant you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to access and use the Service in accordance
          with these Terms.</p>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the Service, including by attempting to access systems without authorization,
          disrupting the Service, or distributing malware.</p>

        <h2>4. Your content</h2>
        <p>You may submit content such as text, images, or other materials (“User Content”). You retain ownership of
          your User Content.</p>
        <p>You grant In Institution a license to host, store, reproduce, and display User Content as necessary to
          operate, maintain, and improve the Service.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>The Service may integrate with third-party products or services (for example, authentication providers). Your
          use of third-party services is subject to their terms and policies.</p>
        <p>We are not responsible for third-party services and do not guarantee their availability, security, or
          performance.</p>

        <h2>6. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms
          or if required by law.</p>
        <p>You may stop using the Service at any time.</p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL
          WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p>
